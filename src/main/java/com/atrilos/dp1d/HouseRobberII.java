/**
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed.
 * All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one.
 * Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
 * <p>
 * Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [2,3,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
 * Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3]
 * Output: 3
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 100
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
